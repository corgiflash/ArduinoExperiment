FC-5 Bluetooth setup
Connect the circuit:
HC-05 module
Arduino Nano 
Solid Core Jumper Wires: 8 â€“ 10.
Breadboard
Resistor: 1k ohm and 2k Ohm
 
The figure above shows how to setup the circuit. After connecting all the part correctly, uploads following codes into the Nano. 
The code is communicating to the host computer and software serial using the HC-05 module. It sends entered data in serial monitor 
to the Bluetooth module. It also copies anything received from the Bluetooth module to the serial monitor. For the command user 
guide, please checking following guide: http://www.martyncurrey.com/?wpdmdl=2248
On the received part, you can install the Arduino Bluetooth control app on an android phone from google play. 
You can also write your own Bluetooth connection app as your own convince
